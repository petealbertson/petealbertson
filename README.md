## Hello, I'm Pete

Iâ€™m a digital product developer who most enjoys opportunities to collaborate with clients to build software that helps them do whatever they do better. Whether itâ€™s helping choose and configure SaaS tools, building integrations between them, or designing and crafting custom apps, Iâ€™m most excited when Iâ€™m helping organizations solve their most important problems.

I'm also open to contract and possibly full-time roles. I'm originally from the United States, but I currently reside in Veracruz, Mexico.
